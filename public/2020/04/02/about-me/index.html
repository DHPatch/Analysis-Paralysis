<p>My name is David. I am a data analyst in the UK, currently working in the finance sector.<br>
<em>Background</em>
I did my undergrad degree in Physics.
I then did a PhD in solid state physics. At the time I thought this didn&rsquo;t include a lot of data analysis, actually it did - I just wasn&rsquo;t writing code. I worked in a team of less than 10 researchers.<br>
After completing my PhD I spent the next 2 years in the civil service, writing official statistics and doing research into educational assessment. This felt more like being a read analyst as I spent more of my time writing code. I worked with over 20 researchers in an organisation of ~200 colleagues.<br>
Since then I have been working as a data analyst in finance. I work in team of over 70 analysts, one of many analytics teams in an organisation with over 200,000 colleagues.</p>
<p>This is to say: I&rsquo;ve worked in academia, the public sector and the private sector. I&rsquo;ve worked in small, medium and big teams. I haven&rsquo;t seen it all, but I&rsquo;ve seen a range.</p>
<h3 id="new-posts">New posts</h3>
<p>There will be new posts. I will try to make them as correct as possible, to my knowledge, at that point in time.<br>
That said, I will get it wrong sometimes, when I don&rsquo;t - eventually it will be out of date (even my opinions expire and are replaced with better ones).</p>
<h3 id="current-best-version">Current best version</h3>
<p>I will try to maintain a &lsquo;<em>current best version</em>', that way if you land on a post after googling your current problem and find yourself following a blog post 5 years old and you keep thinking &ldquo;there&rsquo;s probably a better way of doing this now&rdquo; - I will try to link you to that better version.</p>
<h3 id="topics">Topics</h3>
<h4 id="the-r-language">The R language</h4>
<p>My main tool of choice for data analysis is the R programming language. Why R?
Well, it&rsquo;s what they used in my second workplace, and so far I&rsquo;m yet to be convinced to give it up for the alternatives.</p>
<h4 id="working-as-an-analyst">Working as an analyst</h4>
<p>&ldquo;Doing data analysis&rdquo; includes writing scripts, pulling from databases, working with spreadsheets and making plots.<br>
But all of this is only part of being an analyst. Sometimes, I will write about these other parts, such as: project workflow, working with stakeholders, designing your output for the audience, working on the right thing, asking good questions, when to say &lsquo;No.&rsquo; to requests, when to say &lsquo;Alternatively&hellip;&rsquo; to requests.</p>
<h4 id="organising-and-integrating-analytics-teams">Organising and integrating analytics teams</h4>
<p>No individual is perfect.<br>
No organisation is perfect.<br>
No team is perfect.</p>
<p>So if you are worried because you are not perfect, the team you are on isn&rsquo;t using best practice, or your organisation doesn&rsquo;t know what to do with a team of analysts - take some solace in that you are in good company.</p>
<p>That said, we should strive to be better at all of these things. Not because we will become perfect, but because we will be better for it - and no one likes to feel like they are stagnating.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-the-purpose-data-analysis">What is the purpose data analysis</h4>
<p>With more tools, more data, more people, more money and more conversations about data analysis it&rsquo;s easy to not see the wood for the trees.<br>
Every now and then, I will step back, do some navel gazing and try to ask - &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the goal of all this?&rdquo;</p>
