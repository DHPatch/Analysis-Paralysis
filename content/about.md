## Hey hey
My name is David. I am a data analyst in the UK, currently working in the finance sector.  
Opinions are my own.

### New posts
There will be new posts. I will try to make them as correct as possible, to my knowledge, at that point in time.  

### Current best version
I will try to maintain a '*current best version*', that way if you land on a post after googling your current problem and find yourself following a blog post 5 years old and you keep thinking "there's probably a better way of doing this now" - I will try to link you to that better version.

### Topics

#### The R language
My main tool of choice for data analysis is the R programming language. 

#### Working as an analyst
Sometimes I will write about these other parts of being an analyst, such as: project workflow, working with stakeholders, designing your output for the audience, working on the right thing, asking good questions...

#### Organising and integrating analytics teams
No individual is perfect.  
No organisation is perfect.  
No team is perfect.  

That said, we should strive to be better at all of these things. 

#### What is the purpose data analysis
Every now and then, I will step back, do some navel gazing and try to ask - "What's the goal of all this?"---
