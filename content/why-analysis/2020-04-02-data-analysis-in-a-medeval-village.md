## The heroes journey
We join our young hero where many innocent heroes-to-be bein:  
In a remote farming village, where everyone gets by with the basic necessities.


### Journey's beginnings
A village elder grabs the arm a small child running passed.  
*Elder*: I need you to go round the village and ask everyone how many fields they've got - I want to know how many, and who owns then  
*Child*: Why?  
*Elder*: Deciding what crops to plant, and when we've decided we need to tell people what to grow. 

- collect the data
- basic analysis: a group sum
- why ask who owns them? It's not just a matter of analysing data (sum), nor even making a decision (deciding how much to grow of what crop), it is to take action (planting crops) with the aim of some outcome (growing the best range and amount of crops).

* Fields different sizes
* Fields of different quality
* Different crops prefer different conditions
* Different workers will use different methods - which methods are best?
  + Spacing crops
  + Inter-planting species
* Some crops effective over different time periods (trees)
* Extreme/different weather in different years
+ How much food should you store?
* New crops become available - are they worthwhile?
* Can existing crops be improved?
* What you want nutrition, not just more food
* Should all available resources be given up for food? What about
  + Building materials
  + Defence
  + Infrastructure
  + Culture & entertainment

It is important that analysts understand the goal of the analysis.
Simply taking a request, you will (hopefully) get the result to the question they asked. But they might be missing crucial insight to make a better decision, take better actions and increase the probability of getting the outcome you want.  

Sometimes, it even turns out that the outcome you thought was the highest goal (food) is actually just part of a greater goal (nutrition).  

Some of these questions, driven by agriculture, reveal whole new areas of analytics
- Weather forecasting (meteorology)
- Improving plants (biology & horticulture)
- Mapping (cartography)
- Experiment design
- Cost-benefit analysis (economics)  

But the elder doesn't know all of this. Sure, questions like 'are all the fileds of a standard size' could be asked up front, and take only a basic knowledge of agriculture (domain knowledge). But, some of these cruital parts of the analysis (what happens if the weather is poor next year) won't be revealed until the analysis is done, the decision made, the action is taken. Scoping the analysis requires domain knowledge, and preferably iteration.
